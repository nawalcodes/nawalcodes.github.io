# Python using Dlang

create a Dlang library that python can call and use

## How to use
1) run `python3 setup.py install`
    - this will create a library that a python file can link to
    - in this example it will create the "hello" library (can be changed in setup.py)

2) run `test.py`
    - this will add two numbers, print the result and square a number then print the result (both functions from the Dlibrary)
