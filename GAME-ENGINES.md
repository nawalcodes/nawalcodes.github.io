# The Final Project!

- For this assignment you are going to be building a 'Game Maker' as your final project! 
- You will use your engine to make a game with at least '3' scenes.

## Logistics

- You will put all of your code and deliverables in the [Engine](./Engine) directory.
	- You can have a separate 'game' directory if you otherwise choose.
<!-- NOTE:  This semester you will be completing the project yourself.
- You will be working on this assignment as a team on your choice (or a combination) of the Mac, Linux, or Windows Operating Sytstem.
- Make sure everyone has a way to work on this codebase, with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the project log)

## Post Mortem Reflections

When it comes to building a game, the most obvious answer in terms of improvement is to incorporate more assets into the game. More sprites, more characters with attractive designs, more strange audios to couple with the visual effects, etc. However, one key area of improvement would definitely have been a chance to refactor our code, especially in the files concerning the Component and GameObject classes as those files could be significantly modularized. 

In terms of the game design itself, I would add new levels and distinguish them with new tile maps in the background - currently the only tile map is the grass in the background, and add some more audio for gaining coins, zapping lasers, and for interacting with different textures and surfaces. 

Further improvements would include a more robust math library with more complex vector mathematics outlined (e.g. cross product, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) to enable a more well-constructed physics engine to be operational. 

## Universal Resources

You will be using SDL to build this project and the same libraries that we have been using during the semester.
